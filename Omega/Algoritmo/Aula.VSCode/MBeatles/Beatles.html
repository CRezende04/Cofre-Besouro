Take a sad song and make it better<br>
Remember to let her into your heart<br>
Then you can start to make it better<br>

You were made to go out and get her<br>
The minute you let her under your skin<br>
Then you begin to make it better<br>
And anytime you feel the pain, Hey, Jude, refrain<br>
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders<br>
For well you know that it's a fool<br>
Who plays it cool<br>
By making his world a little colder<br>
Nah,nah,nah,nah,nah,nah,nah,nah,nah, Hey, Jude, don't let me down<br>
You have found her, now go and get her<br>
Remember to let her into your heart<br>
Then you can start to make it better<br>
So let it out and let it in, Hey, Jude, begin<br>
You're waiting for someone to perform with<br>
And don't you know that it's just you, Hey, Jude, you'll do<br>
The movement you need is on your shoulder<br>
Nah,nah,nah,nah,nah,nah,nah,nah,nah, Hey, Jude, don't make it bad<br>
Take a sad song and make it better<br>
Remember to let her under your skin<br>
